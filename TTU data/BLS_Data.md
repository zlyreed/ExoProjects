- **[Definitions of Injuries and illnesses](https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/soii/concepts.htm):** 

  The distinction between occupational injury and occupational illness was eliminated from OSHA recordkeeping guidelines when revisions were implemented in 2002. The OSHA guidelines now define an injury or illness as an abnormal condition or disorder. For purposes of clarification for SOII, these terms are still defined separately. Nature codes from the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS) manual are used to code distinct injury and illness cases.

   **Occupational injury is any injury**, such as a cut, fracture, sprain, amputation, and so forth, that results from a work-related event or from a single instantaneous exposure in the work environment.

   **Occupational illness is any abnormal condition or disorder caused by exposure to factors associated with employment, other than those resulting from an instantaneous event or exposure**. It includes **acute and chronic illnesses or diseases** that may be caused by inhalation, absorption, ingestion, or direct contact. Five categories of occupational illnesses and disorders are used to classify recordable illnesses, described as follows. Examples of each category are provided, but these are not a complete listing of the types of illnesses and disorders that are counted under each category. (See the OIICS manual for a more comprehensive list of injuries and illnesses and their associated codes.)

- **Q: What does "falls, slips and trips" refer to in BLS?**

  --- In the context of BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics), **"falls, slips, and trips" refers to workplace accidents that are caused by a loss of balance**, resulting in a fall to a lower level. These types of accidents can occur in a variety of settings, including construction sites, factories, offices, and retail stores. They can result in serious injuries, such as fractures, head injuries, and sprains, and are a leading cause of workplace accidents and lost work days. The BLS collects data on falls, slips, and trips as part of its ongoing efforts to track and prevent workplace accidents and promote safety in the workplace.

- **Q: What are the differences between "injuries" and "illnesses" in BLS?**

  --- In the context of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), "injuries" and "illnesses" refer to two different types of workplace events that result in harm to employees.
  
  **An "injury" is defined by the BLS as a harm that is caused by a single, sudden event**, such as a fall, a cut, or a burn. Injuries can occur in a wide range of settings and can result in a variety of physical harm, from minor cuts and bruises to more serious injuries such as fractures, amputations, and head injuries.
  
  **An "illness" refers to a condition that develops over time**, such as an occupational disease or a repetitive strain injury. Illnesses can result from exposure to hazardous materials, repetitive motions, or long-term exposure to environmental factors such as noise or vibration.
  The BLS collects data on both injuries and illnesses as part of its ongoing efforts to track and prevent workplace events that result in harm to employees. This information is used to help identify trends, target specific hazards, and promote safety in the workplace.

- **Q: Can MSDs cause by falls, slips and trips in BLS?**

  --- Yes, falls, slips, and trips can result in musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the context of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). MSDs are conditions that affect the muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, and other soft tissues, and can result from a wide range of physical stressors, including repetitive motions, forceful exertions, and awkward postures.
  
  In some cases, falls, slips, and trips can result in sudden and traumatic injuries that can cause MSDs. For example, a fall from a height may result in a sprained ankle, a strained back, or a broken arm. In other cases, falls, slips, and trips can result in more gradual and insidious MSDs that develop over time as a result of chronic exposure to physical stressors.

- **Q: What does "health" and "safety" of workers refer to?**
  
   --- The "health" and "safety" of workers refers to the physical and mental well-being of employees in the workplace.
  
  **"Health" refers to the overall state of physical and mental health of an individual.** In the context of the workplace, this includes issues related to occupational health, such as exposure to hazardous materials, repetitive motions, and long hours. It also encompasses general health issues, such as access to healthcare, nutrition, and physical activity.
  
  **"Safety" refers to the measures taken to protect workers from accidents, injuries, and illnesses that may occur in the workplace.** This includes measures related to fire safety, hazardous materials, and personal protective equipment. It also includes programs and policies aimed at reducing the risk of workplace accidents, such as safety training, hazard identification, and accident investigation.
  
  The health and safety of workers is a critical concern for employers, as it has a direct impact on the well-being of employees, the efficiency of the workplace, and the overall success of a business. Employers are responsible for ensuring that the workplace is safe and healthy for employees, and for providing appropriate training and resources to help employees stay healthy and safe on the job.
  
- **Q: Are "falls" and "slips, trips, and falls" considered separate categories based on the cause of the injury in BLS?**

  --- "Falls" refers to injuries that occur as a result of a worker falling **from one level to another**, such as from a ladder or a roof.

    "Slips, trips, and falls" refers to a broader category that encompasses all types of injuries that result from a worker slipping, tripping, or falling, including those that occur as a result of slipping on a wet surface, tripping over an object, or **falling from the same level**, such as on a flat surface.
    
    So, the distinction between "falls" and "slips, trips, and falls" is based on the specific cause of the injury, with "falls" being a subcategory of "slips, trips, and falls".
    
    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in 2020, the rate of nonfatal injuries resulting from falls in **the private construction industry** in the United States was 3.1 cases per 100 equivalent full-time workers.
    
    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in 2020, the average rate of nonfatal injuries resulting from falls in all private industry in the United States was 0.6 cases per 100 equivalent full-time workers.
